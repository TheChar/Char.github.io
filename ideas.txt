have a page for how to code a website in html css js and bootstrap (This should include the 4 link lines to
bootstrap and its libraries).

home page slideshow that scrolls through different things you can click on and use pagination

page for food

page for rocketry

page for Jesus / Theology

page for computer tricks

easter egg page at /easteregg.html
    This page can be a page for all the random stupid stuff that doesn't matter.

maybe a photography page at some point?

page for programming projects (link the following):
    2020 Scouting App (No php enabled)
    Source Code for website
    VsCode Extensions
    Discord Bot

include instagram and github links.

slideshow should change once every 3 to 4 seconds using animations. A red-yellow bar will run along the bottom
of the screen to tell users how long until the image switches. If the user hovers over the slideshow, the 
animation and indicator bar will stop, and two red-yellow arrows will appear at the edges of the image.
Those can be clicked to force the slideshow to go to a specific slide.

The footer should have copyright as well as a sitemap. Link hovering on sitemap will cause the link to 
appear red-yellow.

There should definitely be a customizable chrome startup page where users can place things they want for startup.
