<!-- Make a world where there are different minigames. The player will need to log in to the site. After logging in, the player gets one
character to start with, and will gradually earn more and more to unlock more characters and more minigames. This should be a free to play
game. Try to add dialogue with the down arrow in the corner. When the character clicks on the dialogue box, it continues to the next box.
Find out how to do advertisements once program is complete.
Minigames:
  Duel
  Mario Style Obstacle course (named story mode)
  Multiplayer Active Fighter (like SSB)

For Duel, players will each get to pick one of three options. Attack, Defend, or Special are the options. This platform is similar to 
rock paper scissors where attack beats special, defend beats attack, and special beats defend. The players current avatar will determine 
what the animations will look like if there are any. 

Mario Style Obstacle course will be a side-scroller where the player needs to go in to 8 different realms to collect shards that were 
stolen by the bad guys. They can use the shards to unlock new abilities (like runes in botw). -->
