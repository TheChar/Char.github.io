<!-- Make a world where there are different minigames. The player will need to log in to the site. After logging in, the player gets one
character to start with, and will gradually earn more and more to unlock more characters and more minigames. This should be a free to play
game. Try to add dialogue with the down arrow in the corner. When the character clicks on the dialogue box, it continues to the next box.
Find out how to do advertisements once program is complete.
Minigames:
  Duel
  Mario Style Obstacle course (named story mode)
  Multiplayer Active Fighter (like SSB)

For Duel, players will each get to pick one of three options. Attack, Defend, or Special are the options. This platform is similar to 
rock paper scissors where attack beats special, defend beats attack, and special beats defend. The players current avatar will determine 
what the animations will look like if there are any. The game should incorporate php so that players can play with each other on a password
encrypted server that is created by the player (similar to geoarena where you  can have a custom match with only people you choose). 

Mario Style Obstacle course will be a side-scroller where the player needs to go in to 8 different realms to collect shards that were 
stolen by the bad guys. They can use the shards to unlock new abilities (like runes in botw). The enemies can incorporate shielded enemies (represented with a shield and different color),
greater attack enemies(represented by holding a sword with different colored armor) as physical non-elemental types or as the following depending on current realm. water type enemies(drop seashell || rare bubble) fire type enemies(drop a flame || rare lava rock)
plant type enemies(drop a leaf || rare acorn) death type enemies(drop a bone || rare skull) light type enemies(drop glowing orb || rare crystallized sun beam (shape of obelisk))
ice type enemies(drop a snowflake || rare penguin statuette) lightning type enemies(drop a lightning bolt || rare thunderclap) star type(drops a star || rare comet.
Player is able to trade with the various shopkeepers throughout the 8 realms, as well as with Igor the night storekeeper and with Ivan the day storekeeper. Ivan and Igor can be found in any of 
the 8 realms. This game is intended to be single player, but 2 player may be incorporated at a later date

Multiplayer active fighter is on hold until Duel has been released-->
